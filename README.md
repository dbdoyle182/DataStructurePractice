# DataStructurePractice

This is a quick guide/study tool that will explore different types of data structures in programming. Initially this will be primarily JavaScript but I would like to add either the same or different structures in the future with different languages.

## Prerequisites

* Be sure to install jest globally, this can be done like so: `npm install -g jest` (Be sure to do this in your root directory)
